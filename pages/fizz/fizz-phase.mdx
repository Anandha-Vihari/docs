# Fizzer Onboarding Phases

We have launched 5 phases to onboard 100,000 Fizzers into the network. These Fizzers will form the foundation of Spheron, enabling AI from the edge and contributing to network decision-making and operations.

The phases are named after celestial bodies in our solar system, symbolizing our vision of a vast, interconnected network of compute nodes, each contributing to a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem.

## Frequently Asked General Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. How do I join the Fizz Node program? 
To join, simply register on the [Fizz platform](https://fizz.spheron.network/), download and install the Fizz Node on your device, and start contributing your computing power to the network.

#### 2. Which regions are eligible for participation?
Fizzer onboarding is open globally. Phase 1 successfully achieved participation from 170+ unique regions.

#### 3. What are FN points and how do I earn them? 
FN points are earned by running a Fizz Node and participating in the network. You can earn Liveness Rewards (FN points) for keeping your node online and active. [Click here](/fizz/reward-details) to learn more about rewards.

#### 4. Can I join Fizz Node if I don’t meet the minimum requirements? 
The program is designed for users who meet the minimum requirements. If your hardware does not meet these, you may need to upgrade before joining.

#### 5. What happens if I don’t meet the minimum system requirements? 
If you fall below the minimum system requirements, your points will be slashed.

#### 6. Can I still get the OG Fizzer role on Discord?
The OG Fizzer role was exclusive to the first 5,000 users who downloaded and ran the Fizz node on their devices. Unfortunately, it is no longer available.

#### 7. Will I still receive a Discord role if I join after the first 5,000 users?
Yes! Users who join after the first 5,000 will be assigned a Fizzer role based on the phase they joined (see phase details above).

#### 8. What is the difference between OG Fizzer and Lunar Fizzer roles? 
OG Fizzers are the first 5,000 participants, while Lunar Fizzers are part of Phase II (next 25,000 users). 

#### 9. Can I transfer my Fizz Node to another wallet address if my wallet is compromised? 
Unfortunately, due to the on-chain nature of the network, you cannot transfer your current Fizz node to another wallet. If your wallet is compromised, you must register a new node with a different wallet address.

#### 10. Are there any fees to participate in the Fizz Node program? 
There are no fees to join, but you must meet the system requirements and keep your node active to earn rewards.

#### 11. Can I run the Fizz Node on multiple devices? 
Yes, you can run the Fizz Node on different devices under one account, but each device must be registered separately with a unique wallet address.

#### 12. Is there a limit to how many nodes I can run? 
There is no strict limit you can run as many node you want with different system.

#### 13. What happens if I stop my Fizz Node? 
If you stop your Fizz Node, you will stop earning FN points and rewards. Ensure your node stays active to continue receiving rewards.

#### 14. How do I contact support if I have issues setting up my Fizz Node? 
For support, you can join our Discord community for assistance: [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/KJ5PhGv3Mw).
